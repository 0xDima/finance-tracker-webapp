I want these columns shown:
Date, Description, Amount(currency symbol and amount)
Then when clicked on that transaction you can see all the info stored about the specific transaction


Filters:
- By default there will be shown previous month, but you can use calendar to choose any month or some time range you want
- Filter by categories, so you can see all the transactions only of the category you chose
